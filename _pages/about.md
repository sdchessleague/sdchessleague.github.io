# What do we do?

We are creating a one-of-a-kind high school chess league in San Diego, unlike any other in the U.S. or world. We intend to offer fully-subsidized participation for six high schools in the downtown San Diego area, including equipment, travel, tournament entry fees, prizes for individual and team performance, and a fully-paid trip to nationals for the winning team. The 2018-2019 academic year will be our pilot season, with future seasons expanding to include students of all ages.

As the pilot season progresses, we will refine the identity of the San Diego Chess League and cohere around a set of core values. We will engage the greater student and school community in this process, for instance by holding a design competition for the official San Diego Chess League logo and team apparel. We will not only espouse the values of chess, but also actively work to instill them in the students. We will hold instructors and coaches responsible for their key leadership and mentorship positions, and we will have all student participants submit reflections on their experiences and growth over the course of the season.

Our approach is holistic; we view chess not only as a competitive sport (recognized in 1999 by the International Olympic Committee), but more importantly as a vehicle for academic, personal, and career success.


# Why is chess related to success?

Academically, the benefits of chess are well known. Programs like <a href="https://chessintheschools.org/" target="_blank">Chess In The Schools</a> have found remarkable success in New Jersey and New York. Since 2011, Armenia has required chess instruction as part of the public school curriculum. Some supporting literature includes this <a href="http://www.academiadesah.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/research_kcfe.pdf" target="_blank">Kasparov Chess Foundation research report</a> and this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426665/" target="_blank">awesome recent study</a> from Denmark. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&ei=3rZ1W-WLHsmo0gLixZOICg&q=academic+benefits+of+chess&oq=academic+benefits+of+chess&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.0.0.0.22836026.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.UB9DiNPqdpc" target="_blank">Google search</a> on the academic benefits of chess yields overwhelming positive support. Chess helps students with their focus, work ethic, critical thinking, self-control, study habits, and a number of other traits that are essential for students in today’s education system.

Personally, chess promotes healthy habits and a balanced lifestyle. Importantly, the game is accessible to all, regardless of age, gender, disabilities, language barriers, or any other background challenges. Therefore, once students learns chess, it is a hobby that remains with them for life. As one of the most popular games on the planet, whenever they visit a new country, city, or culture, students can connect with people through chess. Furthermore, many of the skills chess develops—patience, forethought, sportsmanship, self-accountability—can be applied everywhere outside the classroom as well. Finally, scholastic chess is played in a co-ed team setting, so all the social benefits of team sports are included as well.

Career-wise, chess is one of the most compelling extracurriculars to list on a resume. Significant accomplishment is not required, but simply being exposed to the mathematical logic of the game is helpful in quantitative and STEM careers. And let’s not forget that significant creativity is involved at the chessboard; Marcel Duchamp famously stated that “while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.”

# Who are we?

Mr. Trattner holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics with computer science from MIT (course 18c), where he created and led the <a href="http://chess.mit.edu" target="_blank">Tech Chess club</a> with International Master Alexander Katz, National Master Richard Yi, and other chess enthusiasts. His youth belies his work experience, including entry-level as well as leadership positions in aerospace engineering, academia, government, retail, social media, venture capital, and the nonprofit sector.
